    <p class="card-text">We value your time, which is why you can always rely on our consistent, high quality products as well as our expertise gained through years of development and improvement. We offer you complete solutions, hence our market leading coatings come with all the necessary accessories and illustrated instructions so that you can easily achieve the best results. Our range is offered in superior, custom designed packaging to provide clear information and a consistent brand image. Protection based on silicon dioxide (SiO2) is the most sophisticated car protection technology which has been developed to date. Previously exploited by the most demanding consumers in the electronics industry or used to protect railway rolling stock from vandalism, this formulation is now being introduced in its unique form to the automotive business by the GYEON brand. The crucial properties of the quartz coating are its ability to increase the overall hardness of the paint up to the level of 9H (hardness of the coating determined by pencil hardness scale) as well as its measurable thickness, reaching up to 1 micron. The most critical thing, however, is the structural integrity that the layer displays. After vaporizing all the solvents contained in the product, where 90 % evaporates within the first 24 hours and a total of 100% vaporization might be accomplished after 14 days, the layer becomes solid, very hard and highly durable. Owing to the quartz coatings thickness, all scratching and fading which may appear during washing or as a result of extensive exposure to caustic substances e.g. bird droppings, do not reach the paint, leaving its surface intact. Moreover, it is entirely resistant to chemical substances with a pH of between 2 and 11, which makes it incredibly durable and resistant to frequent washing. The only way to remove the coating is through the application of professional, intensive abrasives.</p>
